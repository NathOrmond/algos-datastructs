# Algorithms and Data Structures 

> This is a project for studying data structures and algorithms. 


## How to Use 

> The project contains directories for some of the most common data structures and algorithms. Within these folders there are various example implementations with explanations of how they work in README files contained in the folders. 

> For an overview of the layout of code visit the src/test-example directory

### Running
- All algorithms are tested with a number of cases. To run these use:  ```npm run test```
- Algorithms can be tested and compared for space and time complexity: ```TODO```

### Learning DS&A 
- TODO
