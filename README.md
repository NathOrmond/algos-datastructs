# Algorithms and Data Structures 

> These are just my personal notes for studying DS&A type questions. Feel free to use them as you want to if you want to for practising questions or seeing solutions.  

- Note I originally began writing this in typescript but seriously who cares. If you want to practice stuff in typescript using this go ahead, but also feel free to use javascript. This isn't a production app, it's for learning DS&A and documenting interesting features of solutions! 

## How to Use 

> The project contains directories for some of the most common data structures and algorithms. Within these folders there are various example implementations with explanations of how they work in README files contained in the folders. 

> For an overview of the layout of code visit the src/test-example directory

### Running
- All algorithms are tested with a number of cases. To run these use:  ```npm run test```
- Algorithms can be tested and compared for space and time complexity: ```TODO```


#### To run specific tests 

- for ts files make sure to run the transpiler 
```bash 
    npx tsc
```

- then you can run the tests you want to run
```bash 
    npx mocha dist/path-to-test-file.../foo.spec.js
```


### Learning DS&A 
- Rule 1: Grind grind grind 
- Rules 2: Man was not made for computer science, but productivity governs this world
- Rule 3: Grind Grind Grind
